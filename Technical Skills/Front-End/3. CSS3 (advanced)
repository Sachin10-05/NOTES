1. Gradient:
------------
      * Color Transition.
      * It lets us display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.
      * Types of gradients:-
          -- Linear gradient
          -- Radial gradient
          -- Conic gradient
          
      * Linear Gradient:
        ----------------
            * It goes up/down/left/right/diagonal
            * direction: default/specific-direction/with angle/using transparency)
            * syntax:
                  background-image:linear-gradient(direction, color-1, color-2,.......); ✔ 
                  Ex- background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
                  
      * Radial Gradient:
        ----------------
            * It is defined by its center.
            * To define radial gradient we must define atleast two color stops.
            * syntax:
                  background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at pos, start-color, ......, last-color); ✔
                  Ex-  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, red 5%, green);
                  
      * Conic Gradient:
        ---------------
            * It is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center path.
            * To define conic gradient we must define atleast two color.
            * syntax:
                  background-image:conic-gradient( [from angle] [at pos], color[degree],.......,color[degree]); ✔ 
                  Ex- background-image: conic-gradient(red 45deg, yellow 55deg);




















2. Filter:
-----------
      * The filter property defines visual effects (like blur and saturation) to an element (often <img>).
      * filter: grayscale(100%)                                   -----> It will make the image completely gray (used for black and white images). ✔ 
                drop-shadow(h-shadow v-shadow blur spread color)  -----> Applies a drop shadow effect to the image.                                ✔ 
                blur(px)                                          -----> Applies a blur effect to the image. A larger value will create more blur.
                brightness(%)                                     -----> Adjusts the brightness of the image.
                contrast(%);                                      -----> Adjusts the contrast of the image. 0% will make the image completely black.
                opacity(%)                                        -----> It descibes transparency-level, (0% == completely transparent) && (100% == no transparency).
                saturate(%)                                       -----> Saturates the image.
                hue-rotated()                                     -----> 
                url()              
                initial
                inherit
                none




















3. Shadows:
-----------
      * Text shadow:-
        ------------
            * It is applicable to texts only.
            * text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px red;                    ----->  (horizontal-shadow, vertical-shadow, blur-effect, color)
            * text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px red, 2px 4px red green; ----->  Multiple shadows 
            
      * Box shadow:-
        -----------
            * It is applied to one or more element.
            * box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px lightblue;             ----->  (horizontal-shadow, vertical-shadow, blur-effect, color)
            * box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 12px lightblue inset;  ----->  (horizontal-shadow, vertical-shadow, blur-effect, spread-radius, color)
            
      * Note: * A positive spread-radius value increases the size of the shadow, a negative value decreases the size of the shadow.
              * The inset parameter changes the shadow from an outer shadow (outset) to an inner shadow.
              * Practical Ex- Cards.




















4. Positioning:
---------------
      * After using position property, elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
      * However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. 
      * Types:-
           (i)  static    :- Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. (by default)
           (ii) fixed     :- It is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
           
           (iii)relative  :- It is positioned relative to its "normal (i.e, initial) position". ✔✔
           
           (iv) sticky : 
                    * It toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. 
                    * In this case when element is in its normal pos then it will behave as 'RELATIVE' && if scrolled it will behave as 'FIXED'.
                    
           (v)  absolute : ✔✔
                    * It is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (INSTEAD OF position:relative; IS ALREADY WRITTEN). ✔✔
                    * However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
                    * Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. z-index:
-----------
      * It specifies the stack order of an element.
      * An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
      
      * Note:-  
                * z-index only works on positioned elements (i.e, absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky)
                * z-index only works on flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).
                * If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top.
